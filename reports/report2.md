# Report 1

## Team report (status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project meeting)

### report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

Last week's goals:
 * Make Github pages display the frontend, integrate frontend and backend
 * Add more testing for backend
 * Continue creating and refining functions that interact with Spotify API

Progress: 
 * Website now shows up on Github Pages
 * Testing pipeline using Github Actions set up
 * Backend and frontend are connected and interacting

Trouble: 
 * Jest can't test backend functions because `fetch ` is not defined on the backend
 * 

Stuck: 
 * 

### outline your plans and goals for the following week (higher level)

Next week: 
 * Integrate `axios` into the project in place of `fetch`, should allow testing to work
 *
