# Report 3

## Team report (status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project meeting)

### report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

Last week's goals:
 * Finish a MVP for alpha release
 * Have frontend and backend work together in more detail, make more backend API functions
 * Finish mobile responsive design
 * Integrate `axios` into the project in place of `fetch`, should allow testing to work

Progress:
 * Backend and frontend are now connected and interacting
 * Spotify authorization working
 * Figured out how to extract genres from Spotify (through artist instead of album)

Trouble:
 * Spotify web player access token expires every hour, hard to share access tokens.
 * 
 *

Stuck:
 * Spotify player is only for preminum members, see 1st trouble above
 * Spotify does not have language metadata per song, so the filtering song by language is dead

### outline your plans and goals for the following week (higher level)

Next week:
 * Finish a MVP for alpha release
 * Have frontend and backend work together in more detail, make more backend API functions
 * Finish mobile responsive design
 * Integrate `axios` into the project in place of `fetch`, should allow testing to work
