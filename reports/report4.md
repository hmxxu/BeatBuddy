# Report 3

## Team report (status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project meeting)

### report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

Last week's goals:
 * Finish a MVP for alpha release
 * Have frontend and backend work together in more detail, make more backend API functions
 * Integrate `axios` into the project in place of `fetch`, should allow testing to work

Progress:
 * Frontend now recommends songs based on selected song that was searched
 * Frontend's generated playlist has color responsive feature
 * More backend function created --> mood algorithms 
 * MVP finished
 * User testing carried out and feedback is being acted on

Trouble:
 * Spotify web player access token expires every hour, hard to share access tokens.
 * Player on website still a work in progress
 *

Stuck:
 * Filter integration with the recommendation algorithm

### outline your plans and goals for the following week (higher level)

Next week:
 * Incorporate filters into algorithm
 * Finetune recommendation algorithm
 * continue to improve frontend intuitiveness based on user feedback
 * Get player in BeatBuddy working
